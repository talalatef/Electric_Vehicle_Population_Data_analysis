# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States. The dataset includes details such as the make, model, electric range, base MSRP, and other relevant information.

## Project Goals

1. **Descriptive Statistics:** Explore and summarize the main characteristics of the dataset, including basic statistics and data overview.

2. **Categorical and Quantitative Analysis:** Investigate the distribution and relationships between categorical variables (e.g., make, model, state) and quantitative variables (e.g., electric range, base MSRP).

3. **Geographical Analysis:** Examine the geographic distribution of electric vehicles across states and counties.

4. **CAFV Eligibility:** Analyze the distribution and relationship of Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility with other variables.

5. **Time-Based Analysis:** Explore trends and patterns over time, especially concerning the model years of electric vehicles.

6. **Top Makes Analysis:** Focus on the top five electric vehicle makes to understand their characteristics and pricing.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Instructions

1. **Dataset:** The dataset used for this analysis is named "electric_vehicle_population.csv." Ensure that it is available in the project directory.

2. **Environment Setup:** Make sure you have the necessary Python environment set up with the required libraries installed. You can use a virtual environment or a tool like Conda.

3. **Run the Notebook:** Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform the data analysis. Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the notebook.

## Results

The results of the analysis are presented in the notebook or script, including visualizations and key insights gained from the exploration of the electric vehicle dataset.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the electric vehicle population in the United States, offering a comprehensive analysis of various factors influencing the adoption and characteristics of electric vehicles.
